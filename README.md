# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial first step in any data science project. It's the process of investigating datasets to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through statistical summaries and visualizations.

# Why EDA Matters
EDA helps you:

Understand your data's structure - dimensions, types, distributions
Detect errors and outliers - missing values, inconsistencies, unusual observations
Discover patterns and relationships - correlations, trends, groupings
Inform modeling decisions - which features to use, what transformations to apply
Generate hypotheses - questions worth investigating further

# Key Components of EDA
1. Data Overview

Check dimensions (rows, columns)
Examine data types
Review first/last few records
Assess data quality and completeness

2. Univariate Analysis

Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
Distribution shapes (histograms, density plots, box plots)
Categorical frequencies (bar charts, count plots)

3. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis

Correlations between variables (scatter plots, correlation matrices)
Relationships across groups (grouped statistics, faceted plots)
Interactions between multiple variables

4. Visualization

Histograms, box plots, violin plots for distributions
Scatter plots for relationships
Heatmaps for correlations
Time series plots for temporal data
